Bitcoin Chain Keys Utility

This simple html page (with js code) can add multiple public and private keys together.

Multiple users can generate key pairs and share their public keys.
When you add the public keys you get a master address that can be paid into.

Keep the private keys secret. When the funds are going to be spent you bring the secret keys all together and add them to create a master spend key.

I checked the values produced in this tool against bitaddress.org and they checked out ok. But I did not try to fund and spend from the address generated.

No warranty! Test fully before using.
