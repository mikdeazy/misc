CoinWatch - A simple daemon to monitor for Bitcoin payments and update mysql tables.

This code is adapted from code I wrote to support an online Bitcoin service. It requires python-daemon (sudo apt-get install python-daemon). It polls bitcoind for new blocks or it can poll the blockchain.info API for a more lightweight install. If rpc is not accessible it will try to rollover to blockchain.info as backup.

It maintains user account balances and watches for any payments made to update the accounts. It also updates a "jobs" table that controls something that an account balance allows to proceed or not. This could easily be adapted for other uses.

Brief overview of code:

The main run loop polls for block-count change. When a new block is detected we look at a previous block (according to confirmations min,max) and call CheckBlock to retrieve the block and scan for any addresses that match any of our users. Check4Pmts will look at each transaction and see if it has an output for an account address that has not already been recorded. It updates the pmts table (audit history) and user balance. UpdateJobStatus looks at the resulting balance and decides what action should happen. In this example it checks job costs and changes status to either allow jobs to proceed or remain on hold. This function could be modified to suit any particular application.

Several mysql tables are used. See schema.sql for brief descriptions and minimal sql create stmnts. In my application another backend process detects job status and actually runs jobs. These jobs cost bitcoin and so in my case I calculate which jobs can be run, and update status. Actual job fee is not deducted until job is completed.


Config values control the watching. Initial values can be set by cmd args that get saved as defaults in a cfg file. See coinwatch --help. The config file is updated with block-count so that if the daemon restarts it can continue where it left off.

That's all folks. Hope this is useful.
