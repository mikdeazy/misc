This code was hacked from the vanitygen keyconv utility.

(https://github.com/samr7/vanitygen)

The idea was to have the simplest key generator for fast code review before offline use.

You can compile and run this program without having to use anything but signed packages from the linux repos.

Prep:

sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev

Compile:

gcc -o mickey mickey.c -lcrypto

Run:

./mickey 3
Address: 18uiqewQRU5KNb6ksPsm9itm7ox918bLCn
Privkey: 5K6GN9Rs7XWQPk351Cb8KN3rjW524iTzt1iiAxgJWpqruGmShB9

On linux you can also directly send the output to your printer,

mickey 3 | lpr

And, just for fun, if you have the qrencode pkg installed (sudo apt-get install qrencode) then this gives you a QR code of a private key,

mickey |grep Privkey |cut -d\  -f2 |qrencode -o key.png
