This small password list generator was created to crack the gpg encrypted private key as described in the challenge here:

https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=133263.0;topicseen

It takes a list from file "patterns" and substitutes every possible 4 char pwd and outputs these suitable for piping to JohnTheRipper, which can be used with GPU support to scan a gpg key hash.

Compile:

gcc mkpwds.c -lcrypto -o mkpwds

It support two possible arguments, 

mkpwds [start] [length]

where start is a count of how many passwords to skip, length is how many to output before stopping.
